# THIS IS A POC

## Ownership and Borrowing in Java

Rust's ownership system revolves around the idea that each piece of data has a single owner. Borrowing allows multiple references, but these references come with strict rules.

### Translating Rust's Model to Java

#### Ownership

- Each memory block has an owner responsible for its allocation and deallocation.
- Ownership transfer ensures no dangling references.


#### Borrowing

- **Mutable borrow**: A single mutable reference at any time.
- **Immutable borrow**: Multiple immutable references but no mutable references simultaneously.

### Challenges

Java’s type system does not natively enforce borrowing rules, so runtime checks must simulate Rust’s compile-time checks.

## Implementation Design

### Data Structures

#### 1. MemoryBlock

Represents a block of allocated memory, its size, and its owner.

```java
class MemoryBlock {
    long address;   // Pointer to allocated memory
    long size;      // Size of the memory block
    Object owner;   // Owner of the memory block
    
    MemoryBlock(long address, long size, Object owner) {
        this.address = address;
        this.size = size;
        this.owner = owner;
    }
}
```

#### 2. BorrowTracker

Tracks active borrows (mutable and immutable).

```java
class BorrowTracker {
    private int immutableBorrows = 0;
    private boolean mutableBorrow = false;

    synchronized void borrowImmutable() {
        if (mutableBorrow) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Cannot borrow immutably while a mutable borrow exists.");
        }
        immutableBorrows++;
    }

    synchronized void borrowMutable() {
        if (mutableBorrow || immutableBorrows > 0) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Cannot borrow mutably while other borrows exist.");
        }
        mutableBorrow = true;
    }

    synchronized void returnBorrow(boolean isMutable) {
        if (isMutable) {
            mutableBorrow = false;
        } else {
            immutableBorrows--;
        }
    }
}
```

### Memory Management

#### Allocation

Allocate memory using `Unsafe.allocateMemory`.

```java
MemoryBlock allocate(long size, Object owner) {
    long address = unsafe.allocateMemory(size);
    return new MemoryBlock(address, size, owner);
}
```

#### Deallocation

Ensure only the owner can free the memory.

```java
void free(MemoryBlock block, Object owner) {
    if (block.owner != owner) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Only the owner can free this memory.");
    }
    unsafe.freeMemory(block.address);
}
```

#### Borrowing

Implement borrowing rules using `BorrowTracker`.

```java
void borrow(MemoryBlock block, boolean isMutable) {
    BorrowTracker tracker = borrowTrackers.get(block);
    if (tracker == null) {
        tracker = new BorrowTracker();
        borrowTrackers.put(block, tracker);
    }
    if (isMutable) {
        tracker.borrowMutable();
    } else {
        tracker.borrowImmutable();
    }
}

void returnBorrow(MemoryBlock block, boolean isMutable) {
    BorrowTracker tracker = borrowTrackers.get(block);
    if (tracker != null) {
        tracker.returnBorrow(isMutable);
    }
}
```

#### Runtime Borrow Checks

Simulate Rust's borrow checker at runtime by enforcing these rules in `borrow` and `returnBorrow`.

### Example Usage

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    CustomGarbageCollector gc = new CustomGarbageCollector();
    Object owner = new Object();

    // Allocate memory
    MemoryBlock block = gc.allocate(1024, owner);
    System.out.println("Memory allocated at address: " + block.address);

    // Borrow memory immutably
    gc.borrow(block, false);
    System.out.println("Memory borrowed immutably.");

    // Try mutable borrow (should fail)
    try {
        gc.borrow(block, true);
    } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
        System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
    }

    // Return borrow and free memory
    gc.returnBorrow(block, false);
    gc.free(block, owner);
    System.out.println("Memory freed.");
}
```

## Conclusion

This custom garbage collector combines Java's `Unsafe` and runtime checks to create an ownership and borrowing model similar to Rust. While it cannot provide compile-time guarantees, it offers fine-grained control over memory and enforces rules that minimize errors. Such a system is ideal for advanced Java projects requiring low-level memory manipulation and deterministic deallocation.

**Note**: This implementation is experimental and should not be used in production without thorough testing. Misuse of `Unsafe` can lead to critical errors, including memory leaks and crashes.
